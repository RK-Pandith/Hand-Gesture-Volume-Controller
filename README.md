# Hand-Gesture-Volume-Controller
This Python script uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to capture hand landmarks from a webcam and control the system volume. By calculating the distance between the thumb and index finger, it triggers volume adjustments (up/down). It provides real-time visual feedback using hand landmark tracking and distance-based interaction.
